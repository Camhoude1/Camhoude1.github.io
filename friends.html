<h1>My Friends</h1>

        I have college friends, I have school friends; like any other person. My friends are important because they're the ones that you make the memories with that you wouldnt with your family. I always have a good time with my friends, from going out to dinner to going out on a Friday night. Every fourth of July my friends and I go to a huge beach house and spend the morning, day, and night there playing games and watching <B>fireworks</B>. It is one of my favorite holidays, and is spent with some of those closest to me.
