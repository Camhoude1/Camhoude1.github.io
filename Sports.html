<h1>Sports Career</h1>

       In highschool I was a three student athlete playing football, lacrosse, and hockey. I was captain my senior year for football and lacrosse and I struggled on whether or not I should play in college. Although I miss it I'm glad that I did'nt because as it is I already struggle with the college work alone. As sad as it is to go back home and watch the football and lacrosse games of family memebers I know that I made a mark in my town with the sports I played. And now I'll do the same here with schooling.
