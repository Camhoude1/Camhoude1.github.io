<h1>My Family</h1>

       I was born on January 14th, 2000. My mothers name is Meghan and my fathers name is Kevin. My brothers name is McKade and he was born on August 15th, 2007. He was born on the same day as my parents anniversary; they have been married for 23 years. My dog is 3 years old. She's a bernice mountain dog and her name is Maggie. I have a very big family; that is very family orientated. We always get to together in the summer to BBQ and in the winter to go eat at some of our favorite resturants. Thanksgiving and Christmas are very big holidays for my family, and I'm looking foward to them coming up.
