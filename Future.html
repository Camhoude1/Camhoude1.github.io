    	<h1>Future Goals</h1>


        In the future my goals are to get a job that pays well. I plan to get married and have some kids. A normal life with normal things. But if the future ends up making me ritcher then I could imagine then I would be fine with that too. Maybe I'll invent something, or win the lottary, I dont know what will happen only time will tell!
